The structure and behavior of the Shopping Cart are as follows:

Imports the "products.js" module which contains the available products for the online store.

Selects the necessary DOM elements for the program, such as the store content, product information, shopping cart modal buttons, etc.

Global variables are defined for the cart and cart total.

The necessary functions are defined to create products, add products to the cart, display a message if the cart is empty, count the products in the cart, empty the cart, update the cart total, remove a product from the cart, show the cart function and render function.

-createProducts(): Creates the products that will be displayed on the web page and adds them to the page.

-addToCart(): Adds products to the shopping cart.

-messageEmpty(): Displays a message when the cart is empty.

-counterCart(): Counts the number of products in the cart.

-emptyCart(): Empties the shopping cart.

-updateTotalCart(): Updates the shopping cart total.

-removeFromCart(): Removes a specific product from the shopping cart.

-ShowTheCart(): displays the shopping cart in a modal

-renderCart(): Function to render cart

Execution: The program starts by executing the createProducts() function. Then, the actions that occur when different buttons on the web page are clicked are described: When the "Add to Cart" button is clicked, the addToCart() function is called. When the cart is emptied, the emptyCart() function is called. When a product is removed from the cart, the removeFromCart() function is called.
